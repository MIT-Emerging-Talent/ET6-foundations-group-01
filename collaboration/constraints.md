# Constraints

The group will operate under the following boundaries for the successful completion of the project.

## External

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Project Deadlines**:  
  The project must be completed within the agreed timeframe, with weekly milestones to track progress.

- **Technologies**:  
  The project will use predefined tools such as GitHub for collaboration and Python for coding.

- **Connectivity**:  
  Reliable internet access is required for meetings and code sharing, though some members may face connectivity issues.

- **Meeting Schedule**:  
  Meetings will be held at agreed times, but flexibility is limited by members' other responsibilities.

- **Compliance with CIL and Template**:  
  All documents and code submissions must pass the Continuous Integration and Linting (CIL) checks and adhere to the provided template to ensure consistency and quality.

## Internal: Involuntary

- **Skill Levels**:  
  Members have varying expertise in coding, testing, and using GitHub.

- **Time Availability**:  
  Members have different time commitments due to work, education, and family responsibilities.

- **Learning Curve**:  
  Some members may need additional time to learn new tools or techniques, which could affect timelines.

- **Personal Obligations**:  
  External responsibilities like exams or family events may temporarily limit availability.

## Internal: Voluntary

- **Coding Style & Conventions**:  
  The group will follow an agreed-upon coding style guide for consistency.

- **Code Review Checklist**:  
  A standardized checklist will be used for peer reviews to ensure quality.

- **Function Assignment**:  
  Each member will prepare two functions, ensuring equal contribution.

- **Testing Requirements**:  
  Members will write and test their own functions and peer-review others' work.

- **Time Commitment**:  
  Members agree to dedicate at least 4â€“5 hours per week, with flexibility based on personal schedules.

- **Documentation**:  
  Each function must include clear and concise documentation.

- **Communication**:  
  Asynchronous communication will be used where possible to accommodate different schedules.

- **Task Prioritization**:  
  Critical tasks will take priority, and non-critical tasks will b
=======
* **Family** - Group participants have families, where they
responsible for their routine.

* **Work** - Time spent for the job can make overexausted,
leaving person with no energy nor motivation.

* **Connectivity** - Group people might have issues with connection.
<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

* **Skill level** - Group have not same skills in Python
knowledge, what might bring dificilities.

* **Time** - Project workers have different ammount time,
which they can spend.
<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

* **Coding style** - Due to difference in participant skills in
programming, they might have issues with understanding each
other's code.

* **Hours to contribute** - Group workers agreed to spend (**TO
BE DETERMINED**).

* **Checklist** - Group agreed to pass a checklist before merging
any code in main branch.
<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
